# Archive of Artwork

The complete archive of work can be compiled with

```
git clone git@github.com:henryrobbins/artwork.git
cd artwork
pip install -e assistant
make work
```

Once compiled, an archive directory can be created with

```
make archive
```

Individual series of work can be compiled by navigating to the corresponding
directory and running the python script. This example compiles the mod series.

```
cd mod
python mod.py
```
